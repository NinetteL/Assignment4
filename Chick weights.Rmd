Null hypothesis: no difference in weights

Alternative hypothesis: difference in weights

```{r, echo=FALSE}
chickenweights <- read.csv('chick-weights.csv')
boxplot(weight~feed, data = chickenweights)
```

### Statistical test

Kruskal-Wallis test for unpaired non-parametric data.

Assumption:

1. The errors are independent
(the 'error' refers to the difference between each value and the median)

2. Data are unmatched (for unpaired data) / matching is effective (for repeated measures data)

3. Samples are drawn from populations with the same shape distributions.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kruskal.test(weight~feed, data = chickenweights)
```
From the results p < 0.05. The p-value indicates that there is a difference between chicken weights according to feed. Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the altenative hypothesis.
